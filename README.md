# Beijing Air Quality Time Series Model
### Mod 3 Project by Paul Torres and Dolci Sanders

This repository contains data collection, cleaning and analyses of air quality data of Beijing
from 2013-2017. We used the pollutant and weather data from twelve sites located in around Beijing's city center . 
We downloaded and curated data from the University of California - Irvine. The data set was provided by the authors of 
*'Cautionary Tales on Air-Quality Improvement in Beijing'* (2017), a paper published in *Proceedings of the Royal Society*.


# Project

For this project, we aim to analyze the sampled air out of the twelve testing sites in Beijing 
in order to identify key trends and predict the levels of **PM 2.5**. This is small particulate matter that can be suspended
in the air for long periods of time before it enters the lungs. First, we moved to combine all of the twelve sites
into a single dataset –– visualizing each of the pollutants and weather phenomenons. 
Then we tested for stationarity, causality between the features, and whether there was correlation between the features and time periods throughout our dataset.
Next, we began to fit models in an effort to prepare our models to predict the last twenty percent of the data that we had set aside as a test case.
